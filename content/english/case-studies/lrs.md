Background: 
LRS, a leading waste and recycling services company, partnered with us to enhance their online visibility through both local and national SEO. Our holistic SEO approach led to impressive increases in keyword rankings and subsequently enhanced their online reach. 


#### Itâ€™s natural for business leaders to be overwhelmed, but keep a balanced outlook

##### Problem

Despite having an established presence in the recycling industry, LRS struggled with visibility in online search results. Their valuable services were not reaching potential customers who used search engines to find recycling services. This issue was particularly prominent at both the regional and state levels. Interstellar Digital was tasked with increasing search engine ranking in Q4. 


##### Solution

We conducted a comprehensive audit of LRS's existing SEO strategy, identifying opportunities to enhance both their local and national search engine visibility. Our team implemented a customized, location-specific SEO strategy to target potential customers more effectively and increase online visibility in strategic locations. Our SEO plan took course over 3 months and Interstellar Digital were to report on success at the end of Q4. 
##### Steps

- Executed a comprehensive SEO audit, optimizing high-volume keyword usage and rectifying technical issues, including duplicate meta tags and slow image load speeds. 
- Conducted extensive keyword research for local and national search terms to drive more relevant traffic to specific website pages. 
- Implemented monthly keyword mapping, regularly integrating new, relevant keywords to maintain a dynamic SEO strategy. 
- Monitored and reported significant increases in keyword rankings and website traffic, indicating a successful enhancement of our digital footprint. 


> Metric 1:  Focus Keywords in the Top 10 Positions Increased by 34% in Q4 

>We targeted a list of keywords with strategic importance for LRS's business and the recycling industry as a whole. 
Our ongoing optimization efforts resulted in a 34% increase in the number of these keywords ranking in the top 10 of search engine results.
