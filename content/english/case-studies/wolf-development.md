##### Problem

Wolf Development faced a significant challenge in distinguishing itself in the highly
competitive Chicagoland roofing industry, especially given the saturation of paid digital
advertising by numerous competitors. The key issue was not just to be present in the
digital space, but to stand out uniquely and effectively amidst a sea of similar
advertising efforts.


##### Solution

The solution involved leveraging a proprietary software called Gnosis, which combines
AI and machine learning to strategize and create an omni-channel experience. This
technology was pivotal in learning audience signals and applying these insights to
marketing efforts. Additionally, comprehensive data analysis was utilized to understand
when and how competitors were spending on advertising.
