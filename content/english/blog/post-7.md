If you’re looking to improve your SEO (search engine optimization) and boost your website’s rankings, it can be challenging to know where to start. It’s a good idea to get an overall sense of your site’s performance by getting an SEO audit. Doing this manually can be time-consuming and tedious—but luckily, some tools can help.

The goal of this post will be to help you identify the less time-consuming issues that could be harming your website’s SEO performance. Let’s dig in!


##### Unique Titles & Descriptions

You want your descriptions to be accurate and relevant. They should also be readable, searchable, and unique. The description meta tag is the second most important on-page ranking factor behind backlinks. There are a few things you can do to make sure your description is SEO friendly:

- Keep it concise
- Use keywords in the right places (this will help search engines understand what the page is about)
- Avoid more than 165-180 characters in total for your description and around 65-75 characters for your title

##### Fast Loading Pages

When it comes to page speed, there are two different metrics that you need to pay attention to – page speed and load time.

Page speed refers to how fast your website’s pages load on desktop devices. Load time refers to how long it takes for visitors using mobile devices like smartphones or tablets.

Both metrics must be fast because Google assesses their performance individually when determining how well a website ranks in search results. Simply put, if your pages take too long for users on mobile devices, they probably won’t stick around long enough for you to even get them through the door. 

##### Clean URL Structure

A clean URL structure is a good thing for your website. It can have a positive impact on your SEO by making everything more organized for your potential clients and search engines alike.

Clean URLs are easy to read, giving you an idea of what the page will be about before you click on it and making it easier to confirm that any links take you where you want them to go.

SEO-friendly clean URLs don’t just help human users understand what content lies within each page. Search engine spiders benefit from this type of structure as well when crawling through your website and trying to index everything properly so that users find relevant content when searching online.

##### Original Content

The content on your website should be unique, not just reworded. You need to write content that is relevant and useful for your audience.

 

To create original content, you do not have to be an expert writer or designer. There are excellent tools available like Grammerly for improving your written content and Canva for streamlining your images.

##### Optimize Your Images

Optimized images are smaller in size and resolution. This means they load faster, making them an excellent asset for users and search engines.

They’re easier to see, especially on mobile devices where it’s likely that you’ll be viewing your website with a smaller screen. Optimized images are better for search engine indexing because they’re easily digestible by Google’s crawlers. Everything from their file format to the type of compression matters here.

Any WordPress site can benefit from a simple plugin search for an image optimizer.

##### Responsive Design

Responsive design means a website is usable across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones and tablets. The concept is relatively new but has become increasingly important over the last few years.

It’s especially important for eCommerce sites because if you don’t have a responsive design, your site will be hard to use on mobile devices – which are becoming more popular daily.

This is a straightforward thing to check. Simply open your website on your mobile phone or tablet and see if you can use all the features and see everything you are supposed to see as if you were a new customer.

##### Get a Website Audit!

A website audit is a way for you to find out how search engines see your site. It’s also a great way to figure out what you need to do to make your site more SEO friendly with search engines.

An audit will help identify opportunities that can help improve your rankings through on-page and off-page optimization tactics. This means that once a complete analysis of your current SEO strategy is concluded, you will receive recommendations based on those findings to know exactly what steps need to be taken next to achieve maximum impact results.
