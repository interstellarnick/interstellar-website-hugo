### 9 Ways to Boost Your Social Media Engagement and Conversions
Most adults spend more than 95 minutes every day scrolling through social media. That is a lot of time dedicated to uninterrupted attention that you can leverage to grow your business awareness and customer engagement. In addition, consumers are 6 times more likely to purchase from a product page that includes social media pictures.

 

Social media marketing is a critical component of your digital strategy, but you need to know how to use social media effectively to get results. Even with algorithm changes and competition for space in newsfeeds increasing, social media can still be an effective tool for driving traffic and conversions.

### Why Social Media Engagement Matters


It’s not just about posting cool content on Facebook or tweeting out links from your blog anymore. Instead, it’s about creating an integrated campaign that will get you results and move the needle for your business.

You need to know how to use social media effectively to get results. You have to show up where your clients exist the most online. By doing this, you create more opportunities for a stronger customer relationship. That is the first step in transforming mildly interested consumers into loyal brand ambassadors.

To help you encourage this kind of engagement, we have compiled a quick list of essential strategies to improve your social media experience.




##### #1 – Capture the Attention

Hashtags and emojis are invaluable for helping users find content on social media. Hashtags are a great way of showing that you’re part of a community. They also give people an easy way to find similar content from other accounts.

Emojis also help with this, especially when they’re used in tandem with hashtags so that viewers can quickly identify what things you want them to pay attention to about your business or brand.




##### #2 – Actively Participate in the Discussion

While it may seem counterintuitive at first glance, there is an important point. People want to connect with someone who cares about what they have to say. If you only talk about yourself and ignore other people’s posts or comments, no one will be interested in following along. Create a community where ideas are shared and fostered, so there is more engagement on your pages and accounts.




##### #3 – Promote User Generated Content

User-Generated Content (UGC) is the best type of content to promote on social media. Why? Because it’s authentic, engaging, and usually costs you nothing.

You can promote UGC by sharing it on your social media channels and including it in your ads. For example, if someone posts a photo with one of your products on Instagram or Facebook, share that photo with your followers using hashtags like #thebestproductever or something related directly to your brand, topic, or niche.




##### #4 – Run Contests and Giveaways

Giveaways are a great way to increase engagement, build your audience and generate brand awareness. This is also an excellent opportunity to cross-promote other content on your website. Ask users who enter the contest whether they’d like more information about your company or product/service, then follow up once winners have been announced with links back to those pages. You are creating a mini-ecosystem that feeds itself so you can capture more leads.




##### #5 – Use Video & Captivating Imagery

Video is one of the most effective ways to engage with customers. People are naturally inclined to watch videos, which means that you can use them for storytelling, educate potential customers about your brand and products, show off how awesome you are as a company, and display your team’s skills in action.

There are so many free tools to create fun and entertaining images. You can build an entire social media calendar of unified branded content and images from Canva and Pinterest.




##### #6 – Post Consistently & When Your Audience is Online

If you want to build a solid social media presence, there’s no better way than to post consistently. Just like any other strategy, if you’re posting on social media sporadically and inconsistently, it will not work. You have to be in it for the long haul and commit to posting at least once per day to build your audience and keep them engaged over time.

Research the best times by reviewing when you get the most sign-ups, sales, or contacts during the day. That will tell you when your clients will be online the most.




##### #7 – Share Relevant Content

When it comes to social media marketing, one of the biggest mistakes you can make is choosing the wrong content. If your audience isn’t interested in what you’re posting, they may not see it, or they’ll spend less time on your page and engage with other people’s content instead.

Instead of posting random articles or images just for the sake of posting something, make sure all of the shared content on social media platforms is directly related to your business goals and objectives.




##### #8 – Utilize Influencers

Influencers are people who have a large following on social media. They can help you reach a wider audience and gain trust and credibility, which will help you build your brand.

Get in touch with influencers in your niche and ask them if they’d be interested in trying out your product. If they say yes, they will post a picture or video of themselves using the product on their account with a link back to yours. Usually, you pay a small fee, and in return, you get a massive boost in your engagement.




##### #9 – Collaborate with Complimentary Brands

When you collaborate with other brands or people, you’re able to expand your reach without spending money on paid advertising. If someone else is promoting your content, the chances are greater that their followers will be interested in what you have to say.

For instance, if you sell pet toys, collaborate with an animal shelter in your area, and make some toy donations. They’ll love it, and so will their fans. You’ll get some much-needed brand visibility while also giving back to the community.
