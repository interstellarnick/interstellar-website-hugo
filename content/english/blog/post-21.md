### Elevate Profit by Using Commerce Media

#### How A Digital Marketing Agency Can Elevate Your Profits With Commerce Media 
 

Having the ability to purchase anything and everything online has provided the world with a level of convenience that is unmatched by brick-and-mortar establishments. In fact, as reported by Statista, “more than 263 million American consumers shop online [some 80% of the population]. 

Shockingly, that same article goes on to state that 263 million is expected to substantially grow to “291.2 million by 2025.” Although these statistics represent just one country, it can be inferred that the rest of the world is following suit.  

Online businesses are following the population online, and there are now an estimated 12-24 million online retailers at this time (WPForms). With so many companies heading online to keep up with the population’s demand for convenience, you can imagine that the competition between online retailers is getting quite steep.  

Every day, businesses are striving to find new and innovative ways to get an edge on their competition and to effectively market their products and services to target audiences. Commerce Media has recently pioneered the way for efficient and effective advertising.  

This strategic approach to marketing has been proven to successfully transform media impressions into revenue by mindfully targeting the right audience for the business in question. By hiring a digital marketing agency that offers commerce media solutions, you will reap the benefits of comprehensive services across all platforms.  

 
### How Commerce Media Will Benefit Your Business 
Rather than treating social media, your business website, and paid ads as separate entities, Interstellar Digital takes a collective approach to making them all work together for the success of your business.  

Working with an experienced digital marketing agency to fulfill your commerce media needs will help you achieve the results you are looking for. By pinpointing your exact target audience, designing campaigns to reach that demographic, and closely monitoring the data to drive initiatives, you will see a transformation in the number of purchases you get from your site.  

 
##### Target Ads to Your Ideal Customer 
One of the first steps to commerce media is to take a close look at your business’s ideal customer. Rather than taking a shot in the dark and guessing about who your target audience is, a digital marketing agency will analyze the data of your social media and business website. 

Once they have gained a clear view of the demographic that connects best with your business, a digital marketing agency will ideate ads and initiatives to draw in that crowd. This way, you are getting the most out of your marketing budget. Think about how much money is lost on businesses that don’t do this research and try to appeal to every consumer!  

##### Personalized Customer Experience 
Everything about your online business will be transformed to fit the aesthetic of your target audience through commerce media. From the presentation of your business site and ads to the types of graphics and videos posted on social media, your ideal customer will receive a personalized experience adjusted to their taste.  

In addition to the visuals being customized to your targeted demographic, a digital marketing agency will maximize your efforts to connect with your ideal customer. By offering special deals through ads and even shoutouts on social media, you will build strong relationships with customers.  

##### Create Mega Fans Of Your Product or Service 
At first, many business owners shrink back at the thought of targeting a smaller consumer base. Instead, think of it more as connecting with and focusing your funds on consumers who are more likely to purchase from your site and become repeat customers. 

By connecting with a more focused group of shoppers, you’ll be more likely to create customers who become mega fans of your shop. These are the people who follow your business across all social media platforms and check in every time you launch a new product or service.  

As a further perk of building mega fans, you will benefit from these individuals using word of mouth to spread the news about your business. According to Business, “Some ways to earn repeat business include starting a loyalty program, offering personalized customer service, giving out coupons for future use and offering freebies.” 

A digital marketing agency will take these initiatives a step further and help you establish close relationships with consumers through social media interactions and customer recognition programs. They will help you go above and beyond when it comes to becoming a memorable business in the eyes of your target customer.  

 ##### Closely Monitor Retail Media Data 

One pitfall that businesses go through is not properly monitoring their consumer data. After all, how do you know who your true target audience is if you aren’t analyzing the types of people who are drawn to your products and services? 

Any advanced digital marketing agency knows that proper commerce media involves monitoring data and synthesizing the information to benefit the business. Furthermore, a digital marketing agency will use that data to enact important marketing changes.  

That is, they will determine what is working and what is not working when it comes to driving traffic and generating revenue. A digital marketing agency will use this data to change what doesn’t work and to double down on the efforts that are working.  

##### Design a Powerful Funnel To Checkout 

By harnessing the power of social media, your well-designed business site, and effective ads, a digital marketing agency will help you create a highly successful funnel. As you may know, a “funnel” describes your consumer’s path with you from the moment they learn about your business to the second they click on your website and make a purchase. 

Your commerce media funnel will entice consumers to go straight from your social media, advertisements, or business site homepage straight to the checkout page. Moreover, instead of encouraging just a one-time purchase, this funnel will circle back and encourage consumers to become repeat customers.
