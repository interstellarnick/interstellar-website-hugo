### Five Essential Tips to Build Your Business Brand
It’s no secret that building your business’ brand is one of the core ways to develop a sustainable future. Establishing a strong and memorable presence will make your business recognizable for the services or products you offer.

In fact, as stated by , “If you have strong branding for your business, people will naturally take note of it much more than they would a business without it. A business that doesn’t really have any cohesive branding isn’t going to stay in someone’s mind for very long.”

Honing in and capitalizing on your business’ brand will improve the quality of every aspect of your business. Advertisements, social media content, and even relationships with customers will all be improved by simply taking the time to thoroughly develop your brand.

The purpose of building a business brand is to become as memorable as possible. Check out these five essential tips for building your business’ brand!

 

### Get to Know Your Target Audience
No, really. Get to know your target audience. This piece of advice doesn’t mean to simply know your target demographics and leave it at that. Gather information about what your target audience likes, what they dislike, and what drives them to like, comment, and engage with content. Most importantly, become familiar with how your business can specifically solve a problem for your target audience.

 

### Define the Personality of Your Business
To effectively develop your business’ brand, it is essential for you to heavily consider the personality of your brand. What values does your business represent? What types of traits do you want your business to be known for? There are many personality combinations a brand may choose to adopt.

 

### Most Common Brand Personality Combinations:
- Bubbly and Cheerful
- Serious and Reassuring
- Humorous and Trustworthy
- Warm and Loving
- Strong and Reliable

While a law firm may choose to be “serious and reassuring,” a restaurant may choose “bubbly and cheerful” as their brand personality. Dig deep, and determine what personality you want your business to be known for!

 

### Choose Your Colors and Logo
Sticking to a color scheme and a logo will help people recognize your business for years to come. There’s a reason why McDonald’s has stuck with red and yellow for years. While Wal-Mart has changed their logo a few times, we will always recognize them for their yellow and blue theme. While colors and logos can change, it is important not to switch them too often. Find designs that you can live with, and use them in all of your advertisements.

 

### Avoid Traits That Won’t Age Well
Avoid slogans that are only trending right now and designs that may not be appropriate in the foreseeable future. A recent example of a mascot that didn’t age well was PepsiCo’s Aunt Jemima which, after many years, people pointed out was quite racist.

Since then, PepsiCo was forced into rebranding, and now the brand is known as the Pearl Milling Company. If you’re unsure about a slogan or mascot, it always helps to ask other professionals around you for their opinions!

 

### Be Consistent Across All Platforms
Your business doesn’t have to be represented on all social media platforms right away, but being present on 2-3 is quite helpful! Your audience will be looking to follow your brand, and it’s important for you to be there for them. Keep your logo, colors, and message consistent across all platforms. This will make it easier for your marketing team to create content, and it will also help your target audience remember your business.

 

### Ready, Set, Brand!
Remember, your brand should represent you. Otherwise, you’re just pretending. Choose features that align with your values and the message you want to portray to the world. For more information and advice about marketing, we invite you to reach out to our  team at any time!
