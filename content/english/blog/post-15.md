### How Digital Marketing Improves an E-Commerce Store
At Interstellar Design, we often get clients who are building or expanding an e-commerce store and need to improve their brand recognition or marketing reach. E-Commerce has reached incredible heights over the past few years with e-retail sales recently surpassing $4.2 trillion worldwide.
Such gains are a big reason why so many companies are popping up left and right, but they often do not have the experience to understand how to leverage their ads and digital marketing. That is when our team can step in to help. We understand the power of digital marketing and how it can transform the success of any e-commerce effort.


##### Remove the Guesswork out of Advertising
Traditional advertising relied on expensive campaigns that targeted a broad audience. Think billboards, TV ads, newspaper ads, and the like. These were all considered “spray and pray” campaigns because they could not target those highly relevant consumers you want the most.

Today, digital marketing and data collection allows you to get the most from your advertising dollars by targeting the right audience at the right time with the right message. It is incredibly cost-effective to conduct further A/B testing. In as little as a day, you can develop a simple digital marketing campaign with highly targeted ads serving the best possible audience so you can continually improve your performance.


##### Target the Best Possible Audience
Digital marketing can help your store improve its customer base. One of the main things that digital marketing offers is the ability to target specific audiences with campaigns, as opposed to using guesswork or trying to reach everyone. This is especially important for small businesses.

With advanced targeting such as demographics (age, gender, income level), location, interests, and behaviors, you can identify your ideal customers and create content specifically designed for them. You’ll see better results than guessing who might be interested in your products or services.

For example, let’s say you sell athletic weights for men aged 18-35. Some potential strategies for reaching these women include:

- Running an ad on Google showing products related to a recent search like “men’s home workout” or “men muscle building”

- Posting a video on Facebook featuring one of your brand ambassadors explaining how he uses a weight to get stronger

- Sending an email newsletter to people who have already expressed interest in your brand by subscribing.



##### Digital marketing Boosts E-Commerce Lead Conversions
E-commerce stores, in particular, require a strong digital presence to be successful. Since they rely on the internet to sell their products, it’s important that they’re effortless to find and purchase from. Digital marketing strategies are able to help reach those goals by driving up conversions.

Additionally, digital marketing can help drive sales on e-commerce sites by making them more visible online and helping ensure that customers have a good experience when visiting them. This is especially important for new businesses or those with smaller budgets who need all the extra support they can get.

Finally, digital marketing keeps customers coming back to your e-commerce site by creating a personalized, engaging shopping experience for each person using it. Personalization is critical because if someone feels like their needs are being met better than other places (especially competing websites), then they’ll likely come back again and again over time instead of going somewhere else where everything costs less but doesn’t feel quite right for them personally.

 
### How Digital Marketing Boosts Online Sales
Digital marketing is data-driven. As the name implies, e-commerce stores are run mainly online, which means that they produce large amounts of data on their customers’ behavior. This makes it possible to create more innovative marketing campaigns based on more than just guesswork. It’s not a shot in the dark, but an educated move made by experts who know what they’re doing.

Digital marketing is measurable. In the same way that data drives digital marketing, it also makes it possible to gauge its success or failure with great accuracy. By examining the performance of your website and advertising metrics, such as click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rates, you’ll know whether your strategy is effective or needs to be tweaked.

Digital marketing can be targeted. Almost everyone shops online these days, which means that nearly everyone has received emails from companies trying to sell them things at one time or another. Yet, for every one of those emails, there was most likely someone behind the scenes who carefully chose who among their customer database would receive this message so that it would land in front of people who were more likely than others to buy from them again.

Digital marketing increases conversions. While all forms of advertising aim for increased sales (or “conversions”), digital strategies have proven particularly successful at this task because they allow companies to track exactly which customers are buying what products when compared to other groups within their databases.
