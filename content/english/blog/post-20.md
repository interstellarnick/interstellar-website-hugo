### Why Does the Voice of Your Brand Matter? 
For most of us, the voice of our brand is synonymous with the voice of our company. A company’s brand is its identity and personality, which helps differentiate it from competitors in a congested marketplace and solidifies customer relationships. When you think about brands with great personalities, consider brands like Apple or Disney. Both have a strong, loyal fan base because of the tone and style of brand voice they utilize.

The voice of your brand isn’t just about getting people’s attention. It is also influencing how potential customers feel about your business. When you’re trying to convey trustworthiness or reliability in those interactions, tone plays a key role in how well people understand what you mean—and whether they’ll remember what you said later on down the line when they need to make an important decision.


### What is a Brand Voice? 
Brand voice is the personality of your brand. When you’re starting out, your brand voice may not be very established yet, but as time goes on and you start building trust with your audience, it will become more apparent. For example, building authenticity means you must be honest and genuine with your audience by sharing the things you are learning along the way, not just your greatest successes.

When we talk about branding and marketing our businesses, we often hear terms such as “tone” or “personality.” These are all different ways of describing a brand voice—the words you use to communicate with your audience. You have to think of your brand as a person you are crafting from the attributes and personality of your brand.

How does this help your brand become something more in the eyes of your consumers, potential leads, and industry peers?

##### 1 – Stand Out from the Competition 
Your brand voice is a crucial part of your company’s story, and it’s the way you tell that story. It can help you authentically connect with customers, differentiate yourself from competitors, and make your company stand out.

Let’s say you’re a new mom looking for the best safety products on the market for your bundle of joy. If you come across two identical products in a store, but one of the companies uses a brand voice that is more empathetic to your late nights without sleep and frustration at not feeling prepared to be a parent, you will be more likely to purchase from that brand because they feel more authentic to your experience.

 

##### 2 – Connect with Your Target Audience 
Picture your customers shopping on your online storefront or in your retail space. What kind of attitude do they have? Are they snarky, funny, relaxed, politically motivated, or anything else?

Now imagine those same customers as they speak. What is the tone they are using? If you emulate that same personality in your own branding language and identity, you will find a deeper connection that allows you to lead the market trends instead of chasing behind them.

 

##### 3 – A Brand Voice Drives Content 
Content is the message you send to your audience, whether it’s an article, a video, or an image. Content is how you communicate with your audience—the words and phrases they see and hear when they visit your website or interact with your brand on social media. 

Content is also the way you build trust, create engagement and keep their attention by telling stories in ways that are personal and authentic to who you are as a company or organization.

When you have developed a brand voice, you instinctively understand what type of content works best with that target market. You adopt a personality that lends itself well to creative pursuits.

 

##### 4 – Solidifies a Business Persona 
When you have a strong brand voice, it creates a business persona. Think of your brand voice as the face of your business. It’s how you want to be perceived, talked about, and remembered. 

Branding extends who you are and makes your company unique. A strong brand voice makes people feel like they know exactly where they stand with your company – this isn’t just a sales pitch but something that resonates with them on an emotional level as well.

 

##### 5 – Creates Consistency
When you’re developing a brand identity for a business or product, it’s essential to have an understanding of what makes up a “brand” so that everything from marketing materials to packaging can be created with a consistent message in mind.

Building a brand voice helps this effort by crafting specific parameters that must be followed in all communication. This persona becomes the identity the brand inherits and showcases to everyone interacting online and off – further unifying the brand identity across all platforms. That reduces confusion and elevates your brand by making it easier to identify by return and potential customers.
