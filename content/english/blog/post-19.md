### Top Tricks for Google Ads to Generate More Conversions
Google.com is the most visited domain. In 2020, it had 74.17 billion hits by people searching for everything from custom cat clothing to nuclear annihilation. The search engine has become so popular that we often say “Go Google It!” when discussing doing a search online.

More and more people are shopping online. In fact, one study found that 84% of Americans shop online at least a few times a year. As more people flock to digital marketplaces, savvy advertisers are following suit. 

With the right strategy, you can turn Google Ads into your source for generating high-quality leads and landing productive meetings with your organization’s top sales prospects.

 

### Why do Google Ads Matter?
The truth is that you can’t escape Google Ads because your competitors aren’t going anywhere either. If anything, they’re likely increasing their ad spend on Google every year. So the best way to stay ahead of the competition is by optimizing your campaign with these top tips.

There are so many free tools available on the platform that you have a practically endless variety of consumers ready to make a purchase with the click of a button. It is like having access to the world’s biggest mall and fighting for the best location.

To make the most of this opportunity, try these stellar tips:

 

##### Create Highly Relevant Landing Pages 
The first step to generating more conversions is to ensure your landing page is highly relevant to the ad, keyword, and search query. Your landing page should also be applicable to user intent.

Essentially, people are more likely to convert if they land on a page that matches their original intent when they clicked the ad (e.g., someone looking for “pool cleaners near me” would be less likely to convert than someone who searched “how do I host a pool party?”) 

 

##### Learn to Optimize Negative Keywords 
 
If you have ever used Google Ads and had an ad appear on search results for terms that aren’t related to your business, then you know how frustrating it can be.

Negative keywords are a powerful tool that allows marketers to reduce the number of irrelevant clicks surfacing in their campaign reports. You remove those words or phrases that sound or seem like they work for your brand, but actually do not. For example, if you have a Mexican food brand that is pulling up results in “bad Mexican food,” then you may have a problem.

##### Billboards
Use Every Bit of the Ad Content Options
There are spaces in the ad options for headlines, tags, keywords, hooks, images, and so much more. Take advantage of every single option so customers will find their way to your ads first. You never know what another competitor is promoting, and one box left open could mean the difference between success and failure. 

 

##### Don’t Forget About Location Settings
Location-based geotargeting is a feature that allows you to show your ads to people in specific geographic locations. This can be done for mobile apps, websites, and even physical areas, such as retail stores.

For example, if you’re running an ad campaign for a new restaurant opening up in New York City, it might be worthwhile to target users within a 15-mile radius of the restaurant’s location. This way, they see your ad when they search Google on their phone or laptop nearby. 

You could also run an ad campaign based on the keywords “new restaurants” or “best restaurants” to reach people looking for new places to try out around town. 

 

##### Focus on Your Audience Preferred Devices
It’s important to remember that not all devices are created equal. People use their phones for searching the web and checking their email, while they use tablets to read articles and watch videos.

If you’re advertising online, it’s essential to realize that consumers behave differently depending on what device they’re using. In fact, Google has ways of telling you exactly which types of ads will receive more clicks based on the device being used by your potential customers 

 
##### Research, Research, Research!
Google Ads is a complex and ever-changing algorithm that can make or break your business. When it comes to optimizing your campaigns, keyword research is one of the most important steps you can take.

There are a lot of different approaches out there when it comes to keyword research, but at its core, it’s simply the process of finding keywords that will drive traffic toward your website. Take your time testing new ideas and reviewing your results. A quality keyword strategy is built in layers based on quality analytics.

 
##### Use a Hook in Your Text
A hook is a sentence or phrase that grabs the reader’s attention. It should be short and sweet, relevant to your content, and never be used as an introduction for a long paragraph.

Think of these as the parts of your favorite song that you cannot get out of your head. The same is true for CTAs (call to action). You want to have a definitive CTA at the end of your ad like “buy now,” “click to subscribe,” and others relevant to your business processes.

 
##### Integrate Entertaining Images
One of the best ways to increase your click-through rate is to integrate captivating images into your ads. The images should be relevant to the product. They should also draw attention from users, especially if you are using a compelling headline.

High-quality and relevant images can be more effective than written text because they generally get more clicks from people who want to learn more about what’s offered. Our brains comprehend images faster than text, so don’t be afraid to try a few different photos in your ads.

 
### Where to Learn More
Google Ads is a science, but not an exact one. What works for one business may not work for yours. There will be a lot of trial and error during this process. That is part of the reason Google Ads are so popular. You can invest a tiny amount to get incredible results without committing to a failing campaign.
