### Why SEO Helps Grow Your Online Presence 
Nearly 68% of all online experiences begin with a search engine. Someone could be seeking out a local restaurant to order take-out or wanting to learn more about the latest news of the times. Whatever the reason, people start by using Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo to find the information they want, and if your website is not optimized with the key terms and phrases they are searching for, you will lose out on attracting more traffic. 

SEO is a key component of any digital marketing strategy. The ultimate goal of SEO is to drive quality traffic to your site, increase online visibility, and expand your brand’s reach. What does SEO do? 

 

### Increase Visibility on Web Search Engines 
Search engines are in the business of providing users with high-quality content that’s relevant to what they’re looking. They reward websites that publish this kind of content by ranking them highly on their results pages. As a matter of fact, most searches choose organic results over paid advertisements, so it’s more important than ever for you to build an SEO-friendly website from the ground up. 

SEO also helps improve user experience (UX). For Google or Bing to rank your site as high as possible in their index, they need to ensure it provides a positive experience for users. Users want their searches to be fast and efficient. They want information quickly, and they don’t want too much hassle while using your site to get it. If you can optimize the experience around user intent, then you can provide exactly what they’re looking for while also increasing customer satisfaction and building trust with them. 

 

### SEO is the Best Way to Get Traffic 
Optimizing your website can be done for free. It doesn’t cost anything. Organic traffic from SEO means that you don’t have to pay for each click as you do with a paid search campaign, such as Google Ads. Instead, the people who will see your website are actively searching for information related to your company. This is targeted traffic. 

You won’t have to worry about advertising bans or changing algorithms affecting your traffic flow. Search engine optimization is something you can control, and it’s not subject to these changes. Your organic traffic will continue in good times or bad because the economy doesn’t affect this growth channel or promotion. 

It also provides an excellent competitive edge. Whenever someone searches for one of your competitors, they will see your listing directly above or beneath as an alternative choice. That means you’ll be boosting your visitation numbers while also taking away market share from your competition. 

### SEO Increases Brand Awareness 
Brand awareness is the extent to which people recognize your brand. This is measured by the number of people aware of your company, products, and services. Brand awareness is essential because it helps your potential customers find you when they search for terms related to what you offer. 

It’s a fundamental part of SEO because it increases the likelihood that people will click through your website or other online channels like social media or subscribe to your email newsletters. By increasing brand awareness with SEO tactics, you’ll gain more exposure and recognition among existing and new customers. 

An excellent way to measure how effective search engine optimization strategies are at increasing brand awareness would be with surveys or focus groups. Many companies do not have those resources. You can also keep an eye on the impressions column in Google Analytics. If these increase over time, more people are being exposed to your brand when they’re looking for related terms on Google Search.


### Quality SEO Improves Your Customer Engagement
The better and more relevant the user experience, the longer potential leads will stay on your site. User experience is about how easy it is for people to use a website to find the information they need. Good web design and content can make it easier for users to search and maneuver through your site, so this increases the amount of time spent on your website. 

In addition, SEO also helps improve the quality of traffic to your website. You are telling search engines to send those people requesting information you provide. People searching for “cat costumes” will be happy when they discover your pet boutique instead of landing on a site for a construction team specializing in cement. 

Having good content on your website can help with SEO because search engines like Google look at these factors when determining where websites rank: 

- Content relevance. This includes things like topics covered within an article or blog post along with how recent the content was published 
- Backlinks from other websites back to yours verifying your authority on a topic. 
- Time spent by users on each page of our site. 
 

### SEO Helps You Generate User Shared Content 
When you optimize your content for search engines, it becomes easier for people to find your page independently. When users can easily find what they want on a website, they are more likely to share the content with others who will also benefit from the information. For example, they may recommend the article or post it to their friends or colleagues via email or social media sites. 

The best way to ensure that your content gets shared is by using social media platforms. Using different media types helps attract users who prefer different styles of content. Some might prefer text, while others might be more inclined towards watching videos. Just be sure to title and place a description aligned with your SEO strategy.
