### How a Digital Marketing Agency Can Use Local SEO to Grow Your Business
Before hiring a digital marketing agency, it is important to ask them how they plan to help you organically grow your online business. While paid ads and other initiatives can be helpful, it is crucial for your business to be able to attract customers and views without paid efforts.
By implementing proper Local SEO, a digital marketing agency can help your business organically flourish without using paid ads as a crutch. As defined by Investopedia, “Organic growth is the growth a company achieves by increasing output and enhancing sales internally.”

 The same article goes on to explain, “This does not include profits or growth attributable to mergers and acquisitions but rather an increase in sales and expansion through the company’s own resources.” There are a variety of Local SEO efforts a digital marketing agency can put forth to help you establish a strong online presence.

If you’re in the marketing for a new digital marketing agency to help you grow your business, consider asking them about these proven local SEO methods:

### Targeted Local Keywords
Digital Marketing Agencies such as Interstellar Digital have professional writers on-call to help them write compelling search engine optimized (SEO) content. These writing experts have the tools necessary to conduct thorough and accurate keyword research.

From there, they write enticing website content that includes these keywords. This is beneficial for your online business on a couple of levels! Since copy and content writers know exactly what to write to drive sales, you can look forward to more excitement surrounding your products or services.

Furthermore, by incorporating local SEO keywords, writers hired through digital marketing agencies will increase your Google ranking. Expert SEO content writers can guarantee that anytime someone searches your niche “near me,” you will be one of the top selections!

 

### Expert Google My Business Setup
Although the average business owner is very capable of setting up their own Google My Business, digital marketing agencies can offer you the reassurance that it is set up correctly. In case you didn’t know, Google My Business is the system that allows your company to be efficiently located anytime someone searches your business category.

In addition, Google My Business provides potential customers information such as your store hours, contact information, and even past reviews. Hiring a digital marketing agency to set up your Google My Business will ensure that your profile is completed thoroughly and accurately. Keep in mind that this feature is only applicable to businesses that have a brick-and-mortar location for customers to visit.

 
### Build Your Social Media Presence
Whether you own an online-only business or your company has a physical location, it is crucial for you to establish a social media presence for your organization. Shockingly, as reported by Oberlo, “Facebook is the largest social media site in the world, with more than two billion people regularly using the platform.” Following Facebook are popular social media platforms such as Instagram and even TikTok.

It has been proven that businesses that lean into social media are more likely to build a sustainable future. Despite the apparent data showing that online businesses on social media thrive more than those who stay off of those platforms, many owners are still choosing to opt-out of using social media to grow their business.

This is because social media account setup and maintenance can be quite time-consuming! By hiring a digital marketing agency to help you manage your business’s social media presence, you can look forward to assistance with:

Social Media Services:
– Initial social media account setup
– Cohesive social media accounts
– Customized social media content
– Content ready to post regularly
– Ongoing advice and guidance
– Social media account growth

Allow a digital marketing agency to make your life easier by taking over the growth of your social media accounts. By hiring experts in social media, you can feel at ease knowing that your business will organically grow without you having to take the time to learn the ropes.
