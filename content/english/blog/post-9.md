#### If you want to learn about why ADA compliance is important for your website design, you’ve come to the right place!

##### What is ADA?

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) came into force in the USA in the year 1990, with the goal in mind to help narrow the employment gap between those with disabilities and those without.

The purpose was to create fertile ground and opportunities for people with disabilities to have opportunities and to have a layer of protection from discrimination.

##### Where does ADA and website design meet?

There are now accessability guidelines for businesses to use in order to be ADA compliant, specifically in removing “access barriers” between the person with disabilities and their ability to solicit the goods or services from a company.

##### ADA compliance and your Google rank

We all know how hot the competition is in an online marketplace that saw a sizeable uptick since the beginning of the pandemic. COVID-19 reportedly bolstered ecommerce to $26.7 trillion , which means a larger pool of customers, but also a larger pool of competition.

There are ways to boost your Search Engine Optimization (SEO) through web design, and one of those ways is by incorporating ADA compliance into your web page.

ADA compliance helps to make your web page more user friendly, which factors favorably with the algorithm. You can also use meta tagging in order to solidify your status as ADA compliant.

##### ADA compliance’s effect on your revenue

A whopping 61 million Americans, which is equal to 26% of Americans, live with some form of disability in their day-to-day lives. A little higher than you would have thought, right?

This is a large customer base to be pleasing (or not pleasing). By integrating ADA compliance into your web design, you are not only reaching a much larger customer base more effectively and efficiently, but you are also tapping into a market that many of your competitors may not be.

Don’t make a ready and willing audience work hard to be able to access your services, as there is a good chance that the very fact that they are working hard to access them may put them off altogether.

Having something as simple as subtitles on your videos, or text to describe images and tables, will go much further than you’d think in the user journey of a person living with disabilities.

##### Ratings, reviews and ADA compliance

Another thing that is very much worth taking into account are the power of reviews. Reviews have recently replaced word-of-mouth recommendations and are now gold dust for your online presence.

Customers living with disabilities will be far more likely to rate your business favorably if they felt as though your company went the extra mile to provide access for them – try to be the exception here.

Even if a customer is not living with a disability, reading a review that shows that your company cares for those who do live with disabilities will show that you are a brand that cares, has integrity and is interested in inclusivity.
